//===== eAthena Script ======================================= 
//= Old Payon Town
//===== By: ================================================== 
//= Sotto
//===== Current Version: ===================================== 
//= 0.2 (Added Guild Flag and Entry NPC in New Payon)
//===== Compatible With: ===================================== 
//= Tested on 14701
//===== Description: ========================================= 
//= Hopefully most official warps and npcs of Old Payon
//===== Additional Comments: ================================= 
//= Payon Elder gives 'reward' which is not standard.
//= Normally he does nothing.
//=
//= The warps OUT of Payon are all working. The warps IN will
//= lead you to new payon, untill you change your own eathena
//= warps, so the only way to get there atm is via @warp payon.
//=
//= To use the Old Payon maps, you need to add these lines to
//= maps_athena.conf:
//= 
//=    // Old Payon
//=    map: payon
//=    map: payon_in01
//=    map: payon_in02
//= 
//= And these lines at the end of map_index.txt:
//=    
//=    // Old Payon
//=    payon 1250
//=    payon_in01
//=    payon_in02
//=    
//= Make sure to leave out or change the "1250" as fits your
//= setup.
//=
//= Additionally, since this script is using a duplicate of the
//= Bunny Band Kafra staff, you'll need to change this line in
//= the default eAthena npc\custom\old_payon.txt:
//=    
//=    alberta,26,229,0	script	Kafra Employee#bunny	83,{
//=    
//= to this:
//=    
//=    alberta,26,229,0	script	Kafra Employee#bunny::bunny	83,{
//=    
//= so it can find the label "::bunny"
//= Also don't forget to change the mp3nametable.txt in your
//= data folder so that you get the right music playing.
